Need to create a solid set of rules for protecting core functionality
and creating strict implementation guidelines. Some ideas:
- You should strive to maintain an elegant Architecture
- You are to recognise and identify when changes have the Risk
of breaking core functionality, and you are to warn about this before making
changes & perform deep analysis of whether the change is in the best 
interests of the architecture, core functionality robustness, and user experience.
