# Potential Issue: User Guidance in Enhanced Prompt Confusing Target LLM

**Date:** 2024-07-26

**Context:**

When CoPrompt enhances a prompt, especially in no-context scenarios where it uses placeholders, it currently appends a helpful instruction for the *user*, such as:
`[Please review and customize the above sections with specific details relevant to your project.]`

**Potential Problem:**

If the user copies the entire enhanced prompt, including this final guidance line, and sends it directly to the target LLM (e.g., GPT-4, Claude) to generate the actual content, that target LLM might:

1.  Misinterpret the guidance as part of its own instructions.
2.  Respond with meta-commentary (e.g., "Okay, I'm ready for you to customize...") instead of generating the desired content.
3.  Become confused about its role (generate content vs. wait for user input).
4.  Produce a less focused or coherent response.

**Current Status:**

The guidance line is valuable for the user of CoPrompt. The current expectation is that the user intelligently removes or modifies this line before sending the enhanced prompt to another AI if their goal is direct content generation based on the enhanced structure.

**Potential Solutions (if this becomes a reported user issue):**

1.  **UI Hint:** Add a subtle note in the CoPrompt UI near the enhanced prompt, reminding the user that the final guidance line is for them and might need removal before sending elsewhere.
2.  **Copy Option:** Provide an alternative copy button like "Copy for LLM" that automatically strips known guidance patterns before copying to the clipboard.
3.  **Refine System Prompt:** Tweak the `MAIN_SYSTEM_INSTRUCTION` to format user guidance differently (e.g., prefix with "Note to User:"), although this could be less clean.

**Action:** Keep this documented. Monitor user feedback for instances where this confusion occurs.
