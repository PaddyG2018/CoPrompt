# 🛡️ Security Remediation Status Tracker

**Started**: 2025-08-05 09:19:27 AEST  
**Branch**: `security/critical-vulnerability-remediation`  
**Backup Branch**: `backup-before-security-fixes`  

## ⚠️ CRITICAL FINDINGS CONFIRMED

### Pre-Emergency Assessment Results:
- **✅ GOOD**: .env files are NOT in git history (no cleanup needed)
- **⚠️ CRITICAL**: 22 files contain hardcoded Supabase keys 
- **✅ READY**: Supabase and build configurations are present
- **✅ SAFE**: Backup branch created for emergency rollback

## 🚨 EMERGENCY PHASE STATUS

### Critical Issue #1: Production API Keys in .env Files
- **Status**: ✅ **COMPLETED** - All production keys rotated and tested
- **Files Updated**: `.env`, `supabase/.env.local`, `supabase/functions/.env`
- **Testing**: ✅ All new keys confirmed working in production
- **Key Revocation**: 
  - ✅ **Stripe**: Old keys revoked successfully
  - ✅ **OpenAI**: Old key revoked successfully  
  - ⚠️ **Supabase**: Cannot revoke old anon key yet (legacy mode dependency)
- **Note**: Supabase still uses legacy anon key - would need JWT-based API key migration

### Critical Issue #2: Authentication Bypass
- **Status**: ✅ **COMPLETED** - JWT authentication enabled for payment functions
- **Changes Made**:
  - ✅ **create-checkout-session**: Changed `verify_jwt = false` → `verify_jwt = true`
  - ✅ **stripe-webhook**: Already secure with custom signature verification
- **Testing**: ✅ Authentication working correctly (401 for unauth, 200 for auth)
- **Impact**: Payment functions now properly secured against unauthorized access

### Critical Issue #3: Hardcoded Credentials  
- **Status**: 🔴 **CONFIRMED** - 22 files contain hardcoded keys
- **Impact**: Supabase keys exposed in client-side code
- **Next Action**: Implement webpack DefinePlugin solution

### Critical Issue #4: Token Logging
- **Status**: 🔴 **PENDING REVIEW** - Need to check background.js logging
- **Next Action**: Remove sensitive token logging

## ⏭️ SIMPLIFIED APPROACH - SOLO DEVELOPER

### ✅ **ADVANTAGES OF CHROME EXTENSION ARCHITECTURE:**
- **Local Testing**: `npm run build:dev` + load `dist/` folder = safe testing
- **Production Isolation**: Chrome Web Store version remains unaffected until you publish
- **No Staging Needed**: Local extension testing IS your staging environment
- **No Service Disruption**: Backend changes tested locally, then deployed when ready

### 🎯 **IMMEDIATE NEXT STEPS (READY TO PROCEED):**

1. **✅ Service Dashboard Access Confirmed**
   - Stripe Dashboard access: ✅ 
   - OpenAI Platform access: ✅
   - Supabase Dashboard access: ✅

2. **✅ Testing Environment Ready**
   - Local build: `npm run build:dev` → test in `dist/`
   - Extension isolation: Changes don't affect published version
   - Backend testing: Supabase functions can be tested locally

3. **✅ Simple Rollback Strategy**
   - Git branch rollback: `git checkout backup-before-security-fixes`
   - Service dashboards: Keep old keys active until new ones tested
   - Extension: Simply rebuild from previous commit if needed

### 🚀 **READY TO START EMERGENCY PHASE NOW**

**Emergency Sequence Progress:**
1. ✅ **Generate new API keys** - Completed
2. ✅ **Test new keys locally** - All tests passed  
3. ✅ **Update .env files** - New keys deployed
4. ✅ **Test backend functions** - All functions responding correctly
5. ✅ **Deploy Supabase functions** - Deployed successfully
6. ✅ **Revoke old keys from dashboards** - **COMPLETED** (Stripe ✅, OpenAI ✅, Supabase ⚠️ legacy dependency)

### 📊 **OPTIONAL MONITORING (RECOMMENDED BUT NOT CRITICAL):**
- Supabase Dashboard → Logs tab (monitor function calls)
- Stripe Dashboard → Events tab (monitor webhook deliveries)  
- Browser Console → Check for any extension errors during testing

- Find old API key (not the current one starting with different prefix)
- Click "Revoke" on old key
- ✅ Confirm enhance function still working

#### 3. Supabase Dashboard  
- Go to: https://supabase.com/dashboard/project/evfuyrixpjgfytwfijpx/settings/api
- Find old service role key (not the current one)
- Click "Revoke" on old key
- ✅ Confirm functions still working

**🚀 STATUS: READY TO COMPLETE EMERGENCY PHASE**
